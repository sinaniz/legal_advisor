        <h3>2. DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>"Confidential Information" means any information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, that is designated as "Confidential," "Proprietary," or some similar designation, or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure.

        <p>a) Use the Confidential Information only for the Purpose;</p>
        <p>b) Hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence and take all reasonable precautions to protect such Confidential Information;</p>
        <p>c) Not disclose any Confidential Information to any person or entity other than employees, agents, or representatives of the Receiving Party who need to know such information and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in this Agreement;</p>
        <p>d) Not copy or reproduce any Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, except as necessary for the Purpose.</p>
        
        <h3>4. EXCLUSIONS FROM CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>The obligations in this Agreement shall not apply to any information that:</p>
        <p>a) Was in the Receiving Party's possession prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party;</p>
        <p>b) Is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party;</p>
        <p>c) Is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Confidential Information;</p>
        <p>d) Is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure; or</p>
        <p>e) Is required to be disclosed by law, provided that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prompt notice of such requirement and cooperates with the Disclosing Party in seeking a protective order.</p>
        
        <h3>5. TERM AND TERMINATION</h3>
        <p>This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of <span class="template-field">[Term of Agreement]</span> from the Effective Date.

        <h3>6. RETURN OF MATERIALS</h3>
        <p>Upon the Disclosing Party's request or upon termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party all copies of any Confidential Information in the Receiving Party's possession or control, or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the Disclosing Party that such destruction has occurred.</p>
        
        <h3>7. REMEDIES</h3>
        <p>The Receiving Party acknowledges that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information and that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to seek injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
        
        <h3>8. MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
        <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements concerning such subject matter.
